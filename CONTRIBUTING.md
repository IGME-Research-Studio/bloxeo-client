## JavaScript Style Guide

We're borrowing [Airbnb's style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/es5) and enforcing as much as possible automatically with `eslint`.

## Pull Requests

* If your PR makes a code change make sure to bump the version number in package.json.
* Push your changes to a feature branch in your clone or fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository in IGME-research-studio.
* Update your Github issue to mark that you have submitted code and are ready
  for it to be reviewed. Include a link to the pull request in the ticket.
* After two other contributors review the PR and give it a thumbs up, then it's
  ready to be merged.

## Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less, if more comments are necessary
  include a blank line in between (makes git log output more legible).
* Consider prefixing your commit messages with relevant issues or pull request
  numbers (IS-1 or PR-2)
